# APS105
Course Projects for APS105 at UofT. 

APS105 is a course which introduced the concepts of the C programming language to me. 
These labs span a variety of fundamental concepts including: string manipulation, arithmetic, pointers, dynamic memory management, 
recursion, and linked lists.

Labs Include:

* Lab 6: Mastermind:
An implementation of a 2-player game of Mastermind. It is code-breaking game where one player tries to guess a code(sequence of characters) set by the other player, with a limited number of guesses.

* Lab 7: Mastermind Helper:
Given a set of conditions, the program prints out all the possible valid guesses for a game of Mastermind.

* Lab 8: Bookstore Inventory:
A bookstore inventory management program, with a database implemented using linked lists. The program allows the user to add, delete, search books.

Note: I did not do extensive error handling in all these programs.
