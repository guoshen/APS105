# APS105

> APS105 is a course which introduced the concepts of the C programming language to me. 
> These labs span a variety of fundamental concepts including: string manipulation, arithmetic, pointers, dynamic memory management, 
> recursion, and linked lists.
**Technologies Used:** C 
**Labs Include**:

* <b>Lab 6-Mastermind</b>:
An implementation of a 2-player game of Mastermind. It is code-breaking game where one player tries to guess a code(sequence of characters) set by the other player, with a limited number of guesses.

* <b>Lab 7-Mastermind Helper</b>:
 The program prints out all the possible valid guesses for a game of Mastermind.

* <b>Lab 8-Bookstore Inventory</b>:
A program that maintains a database of books. The program allows the user to add, delete, search books.

Note: I did not do extensive error handling in all these programs.
