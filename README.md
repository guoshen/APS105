# APS105
Course Projects for APS105 at UofT. 

APS105 is a course which first introduced the concepts of the C programming language to me. 
These labs span a variety of fundamental concepts including: string manipulation, arithmetic, pointers, recursion, and linked lists.
We also implemented a game called Mastermind(see labs 6-7);
