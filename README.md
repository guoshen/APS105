# APS105
Course Projects for APS105 at UofT. 

APS105 is a course which first introduced the concepts of the C programming language to me. 
These labs span a variety of fundamental concepts including: string manipulation, arithmetic, pointers, dynamic memory management, 
recursion, and linked lists.

Labs Include:

Lab 6: Mastermind
An implementation of a 2-player game of Mastermind; code-breaking game where one player tries to guess a code(sequence of characters)
set by the other player.

Lab 7: Mastermind Helper
Given a set of conditions, the progam prints out all the possible valid guesses for a game of Mastermind.

Lab 8: Bookstore Inventory
A bookstore inventory database implemented using linked lists. The database allows the user to add, delete, list
and search through books.

Note: I did these programs as a part of first-year course. I did not do extensive error handling and extensive handling of all corner
cases in these programs.
